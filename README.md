# Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my Portfolio.This portfolio will showcase my skills.

 As a Developer I am aware of how important is to have a good Portfolio because:
 * A portfolio website presents your professionalism and dedication to the craft better and more clearly than any CV.
 * An online portfolio is certain to make the developer available and searchable for new clients. It lets developer potential employers find them the moment they get round to using a search engine or looking through candidatesâ€™ applications.
 * A portfolio published on the web humanizes you as a master of the craft.


 In this Portfolio I have included my skills,little information about myself and ways to contact me.The Portfolio indicates the index.html and style.css files which show how the Portfolio was made and have comments for making the code easy readble.
 



 ## Key Factors

 * The application was created from the scratch!
 * HTML & CSS were used while creating the application.
 * Personal information was added to the application to make it unique.
 * Personal ,preferred colors and design was used to make the Portfolio look personlized.
 * Because of just newborn Web Developer the infomation is limited
 <!-- Hoping to get many more upon finishing the Bootcamp) -->




 ## Visuals

 * At the end of the project you will see the Portfolio look like below video.

 * The above video shows the web application's appearance and fuctionality.




 ## Result

 * The webpage presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
 *  The Website is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
